- Check out my tutorial: _"Program Your First FPGA With GOWIN GW1N-4"_ <br>
    https://medium.com/@ly.lee/program-your-first-fpga-with-gowin-gw1n-4-b0d5c22b9fea

- Download the files in this repo and open `fpga_project` in Gowin YunYuan IDE

- Verilog code was reproduced from _"SUG100-1.2E_Gowin YunYuan Software User Guide"_

- Floorplanner config based on _"DK-START-GW1N4 User Guide"_
    and _"DK-START-GW1N4开发板原理图"_

- Official docs are at `http://www.gowinsemi.com/support/database/`

## Programming the GOWIN FPGA

1. Obtain a free developer licence from GOWIN. You will receive 2 licence files. 
    Set the `LM_LICENSE_FILE` environment
    variable to the full path of the `gowin_Synplifypro_????????????.lic` licence file.

1. In GOWIN YunYuan IDE, set the local licence file to the other
    `gowin_????????????.lic` licence file (not the same as the previous licence file).

1. Set the FPGA device as follows:

1. Run the `Synthesize` step.  Open the `FloorPlanner` and set the Ports to the
    following Locations (i.e. the FPGA pin numbers)

1. Run the `Place & Route` step, then `Program Device`.  Go to the `Cable Settings` screen and click `Query`.  Make sure that the USB cable is connected AND the dev board is powered up via the AC adapter.
